# FreshRSS - Stonetoss Extension #

This FreshRSS extension allows you to directly view [stonetoss](http://stonetoss.com) comics within your FreshRSS Installation.

It replaces the thumbnail image previews with the actual comic, including the alt text.

Some of the images are very large. If you find them too small, you may want to set the "Content width" option in the Display options to a larger setting.

To install, simply place the `xExtension-Stonetoss` directory in the FreshRSS `./extensions` directory on your server and enable it in the extension panel.

# Fair Play #

These thumbnails likely exist in order to drive traffic to the website. Please play fair and visit the site if you wish to support the work.

# Requirements #

You will need [libxml](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.libxml.php) installed to work. This is installed/enabled by default in most php versions.
